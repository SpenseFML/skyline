## Prerequisits
First and foremost
**If you don't know how to solder, it's best to watch a tutorial on youtube beforehand, so you don't damage the controller or switches.**

Here is a list of everything you need, no matter which version you chose:

1x Soldering Iron with attachment

1x Your choice of solder

1x Your choice of flux (not needed, but recommended for easier soldering)

10x M4 Screw inserts (3-4mm long)

10x M4 Flat headed Screws (at least 7mm long in total)

2x M2 Screw inserts (3-7mm long)

2x M2 Round head Screws (at least 7mm long in total)

1x Screwdriver for your chosen screws

10x anti-slip rubber pads

34x 1N4148 Diode (I'd recommend more, if you make a mistake)

1 meter of cable (it's probably way less, but just to be sure)

1x pliers to cut the cable


This should be every basic component you need to start your Skyline journey.
