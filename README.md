# Skyline
Hello everyone, 
I'm really glad that you are here, reading about my new Keyboard.
The Skyline is a 34 key wireless split keyboard with a slight angle and curved layout and agressive pinky stagger.

In total you have 4 choices what to build:
With(out) display 
With(out) hotswap sockets

If you want to mix and match, the world is your oyster, just print what you need, every version has files for both sides. Just look at the prints and pictures to see what is in your budget and what is usefull for you :)

## The whats and whys
This isn't my first self-designed keyboard and I hope it isn't my last. 
My self-build collection consists of:
Lowbro (a plancklike self printed and designed low profile)
Reviung41
Corne (with displays)
Skeletyl (self printed)
dove36 (fusion of the reviung41 and skeletyl, self designed)

The Skyline is the product of all the experiences I made building, designing and using these keyboards.
I wanted a Keyboard, that only has the number of keys (34) that I needed for my day to day work with it and it should look like something new and unique. Also I wanted to use displays in a self-built keyboard, to see how it's done and to make it more fancy :D (it looks cool, but it's not really necessary tbh)
Another important aspect for me is that I just wanted the challenge of finishing a project, that isn't just "print this file from the internet and solder some switches to a controller" and releasing it as a somewhat polished and usable product for the keyboard community to build and have fun with.


## Building the Skyline
Building your own mechanical keyboard can be a fun and very fulfilling experience. 
It can also be very demanding and hard, because you can run into problems and do mistakes, which will set you back and make you start over. 
Don't get discouraged.
Every build is a chance to learn and get better!
I wrote a [build guide](buildguide/BUILDGUIDE.md) for the Skyline with some tips and tricks to help you in the building process. If you still need help or have questions (or want to see other designs) feel free to join my [discord server](https://discord.gg/6NYX3pecrV) and just ask me directly, I'll help as much as I can :)
